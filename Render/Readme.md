3. Adjust main body material setting: Blend mode -- Alpha Blend, Shadow Mode -- Alpha Hashed.
4. Change the transmission rate to 0.8.
5. Add bones for all of the body parts.
6. Create some poses in Pose Mode (Combine using Timeline tool).

Process:
1. Create some meshes (Spheres for the body and feet, Torus and Cones)
2. Use Knife tool to cut more surfaces on the main body by referencing the pic.
3. Create some materials for all parts and assign them to the different surfaces (color -- use the Eyedropper on the reference pic).
4. Adjust/add some details.


Object 1: Guitar

Reference:
Di Giorgio classic guitar (2007) Available at:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Guitar_1.jpg (Accessed: 29 Sep 2023)

Process:
1. Create a basic shape of the guitar reference.
2. Create the remaining parts of the guitar (Head, Bridge, String and so on).
3. Create some materials for all parts (color -- use the Eyedropper on the reference pic) and assign them to the different surfaces.
4. Add text(creater's name) as the brand on the head.

Model Name : Spandan's Anime Room

Process

1. Added the different materials that are used like the planes, cubes, UV spheres.
2. Added the base first with plane mesh, added planks by duplicating and scaling the base.
3. Added a frame by duplicating a wall and extruding it outward and shaping it into 3 frames one big and two small.ed
4. Added a bed by using a plane mesh for bed and matteress and added supporing pillars and used the mirror modifier to mirror them around the bed.
5. Added a shelf with pokeball, books and a cactus plant in a clay pot.
6. Pokeball made using UV sphere and using the knnifing tool to make the center cut and adding different layers of spheres to make the final shape.
7. Added a drawer shelf using different methods like extrusion, sclaing , insertion etc.
8. Added a mat infront of the bed.

Lighting 

1. Added two area lights on to adjust the lighting.

Materials

1. Added multiple color materials for different objects.

Output

1. Used 1080 x 1080 ptx frame.

Render

1. Used Render engine Eevee.
2. Used High contrast in color management








Magnus's works:

Pikachu:

Reference Gathering: I collected reference images of Pikachu from various sources to ensure I had accurate visuals to work with.

Modelling: I began by constructing the basic shape of Pikachu's head, then added details like the eyes, nose, and mouth. I followed a similar approach for the body, incorporating the tail, hands, and feet. To achieve a smoother look, I applied the subdivision surface modifier and used the mirror modifier to streamline the process.

Texturing: For texturing, I created custom textures for Pikachu's skin, eyes, and other distinctive features. In the Shader Editor, I applied these materials and textures to give the model its colors and details. Additionally, I utilized Blender's texture painting tools to enhance the model's appearance.

Doraemon:

Reference Gathering: I gathered reference images of Doraemon to serve as my visual guide throughout the modeling process.

Modelling: To begin, I crafted the fundamental 3D mesh that closely resembled Doraemon's face. Then, I added finer details such as the nose and eyes. I used nurbscurves to create Doraemon's iconic beard and mouth. To ensure a smooth appearance, I implemented the subdivision surface modifier and the mirror modifier for operational efficiency.

To enhance the model, I continued refining its shape by adding additional details and smoothing its surface. The subdivision surface modifier was instrumental in achieving the desired smoothness.

Texturing: To give Doraemon a realistic appearance, I either created or sourced textures for his skin, eyes, and other distinct characteristics. In the Shader Editor, I applied these materials and textures to add colors and intricate details to the model. Additionally, I used Blender's texture painting tools to enhance the model's overall texture and appearance.

Rem and Ram:
Reference Gathering: I gathered reference images of Rem to serve as my visual guide throughout the modeling process.

Modelling : To begin, I crafted the fundamental 3D mesh that closely resembled Rem's face. Then, I added finer details such as the nose and eyes. To ensure a smooth appearance, I implemented the subdivision surface modifier and the mirror modifier for operational efficiency.

Clone: Copy the model of rem then make mirror of the hair and change the color of hair and eye to pink.


Chris's work:

Livingroom:

Early Sketch Available at:

HDR Backplate Available at:
https://polyhaven.com/a/sunset_jhbcentral (Accessed 19th October)

Process:
1. Started with a cube, resized and scaled to sketch reference.
2. Adjusted camera to suit the render view, added an edge loop and then extruded one of the faces to make a mini corridor/illusion to create space effect.
3. Done another few edge loops on the back wall, deleted the face and used the Archimesh add-on (built-in to blender) to create a 2in1 window.
4. Used the HDRI to provide an external view for realism and to make it easier on the render.
5. Created materials and applied to walls/ceiling/floor.


Sofa:

Reference:
-See sketch link above-

Process:
1. Started again with a cube, scaled to size.
2. Created a material, assigned it to the sofa and placed against the wall


Cushions:

Reference:
-See sketch link above-

Process:
1. Started with another cube and scaled to appropriate size.
2. Created a vertical loop cut and changed the number of cuts to 5, then the same but horizontally.
3. Added a loop cut across the center and subdivided it once.
4. Applied a cloth simulation with a pressure of 2.
5. Reduced the gravity to 0.
6. Pressed play and paused near the beginning of the simulation.
7. Repeated steps 1-7 for 2 more cushions.
8. Created materials and assigned colours to each cushion.
9. Placed cushions on sofa base and merged as one object.


TV:

Reference:
-See sketch link above-

Process:
1. Started again with a cube, flattened and scaled to size.
2. Created loop cuts for the tv frame.
3. Created a material, assigned it to the frame and placed on the wall.
4. For the screen I started again with a cube, flattened and scaled to size.
5. Created a material, assigned it to the screen and placed on wall.
6. Merged into one object.
